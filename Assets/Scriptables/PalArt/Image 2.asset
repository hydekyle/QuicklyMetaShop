  description: "Gazan artist Duniyana Al-Amour was killed by Israeli airstrikes in
    Gaza.  \n\r\nLike most of our community, we are devastated at any loss of life
    in Palestine, and during the latest bombings this August, our hearts were broken
    by the deaths of at least 44 people. \r\n\r\nWe know that artists are silenced,
    censored and murdered by the Israeli regime, and we stand in solidarity against
    the death of any artist, and any Palestinian.  \r\n\r\nWe condemn this murder
    and the murder of 44 Palestinian lives.  \r\n\r\nIn honour of her work, we want
    to showcase Duniyana Al-Amour\u2019s pieces."
