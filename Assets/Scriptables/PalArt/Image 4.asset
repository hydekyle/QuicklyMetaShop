  description: "Malak Mattar, age 22, paints powerfully expressionist faces, figures,
    and semi-abstract designs. \nShe first started painting at age 13, during the
    51-day Israeli military assault on Gaza in 2014. A world of self-expression opened
    for her.\n\nMalak now paints in both acrylic and oils on canvas. The motifs of
    her paintings range from visceral feelings to dream visions to abstract concepts.
    Recent highlights of Malak\u2019s career include a tour of the United States
    in 2020, including speaking engagements on college campuses\u2014Yale University,
    Smith College, Manhattan College, UMass Boston, and others. \n\nRecent exhibits
    include a solo exhibition at the Cultural House in Frieburg, Germany, a group
    exhibition at the Museum of the Palestinian People in WA, DC, and a group exhibition
    in Einhoven, Holland, titled Post Colonization (all in 2020). \u201CI strive
    to be an artist and ambassador for Palestinian people all over the world,\u201D
    Malak says. \nShe adds, \u201CEvery human being should be able to live in peace
    no matter what their origins are. The real victims are the children. If they
    survive war, they also have to survive after the war.\u201D "
